## API using Ruby on Rails

This repo contains the API of bycoders application.

To start this project you have to create a folder and put inside of it two subfolders. 
- [This one containing the frontend](https://github.com/jsobralgitpush/bycoders_client)
- This one containg the backend(https://github.com/jsobralgitpush/bycoders_api)

After this, move the `docker-compose.yml` to the parent folder to build the front and the backend container and run `docker-compose build` to start the containers and `docker-compose up` to build the project
